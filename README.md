Hi everyone,
I am a master student who is now studying Energy Technology.
I learned Python and Ruby by myself and am learning about ios development now. Though it has nothing to do with my major, I like the feeling when I can actually finish an APP by myself. I hate myself that why I haven't been starting my study in IT a few years ago. It's so amazing! I am learning data-mining technology as well. Hope I can find more friend on Github!
